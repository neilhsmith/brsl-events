# BRSL

Provides custom functionality for BRSL Events.

## TODO

- Connect lja_sponsor accounts to sponsee accounts.
  - Sponsors can have many sponsees. We'll create user accounts for all sponsors
    and sponsees, create an admin control to connect them with a one-to-many 
    relationship, and use this connect to allow sponsors to edit their sponsees'
    personal info and/or purchase tickets.
- Create user accounts
  - Create accounts, without emailing, for all sponsors and sponsses
  - Create a test sponsor account for Kelli, Kim, and Neil
- Develop Edit Sponsee Info form form the sponsor's profile page
- Develop seat purchase / reservation

## THOUGHTS
- Should I remove the roles when the plugin is deactivated? What happens to users
  that are assigned to one of the roles being removed? I could change the all to
  subscriber?
